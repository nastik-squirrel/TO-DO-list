# TO-DO-list

It is possible to do the following:
- create tasks;
- modify tasks;
- categorize tasks (with colors);
- move up and down with arrows and drag-and-drop;
- set done/undone;
- remove tasks;
- save the list to the file and open it later.

(!) Note that it is being automatically saved to LocalStorage on any change and try to load data from there once launched.

It is impossible (for now):
- manage few lists simultaneously unless you use it on different browsers (or reopen different files all the time);
- sort it in any way automatically (just manually);
- remove 'blue color' while choosing the category (this is actually the most annoying for me now).

Enjoy!
